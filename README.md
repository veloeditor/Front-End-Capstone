# The Smokies Hiking Log - NSS Front-End Project
This is a repository for the Smokies Hiking Log Front-End Capstone which I made for the Nashville Software School Full Stack Web Development course. A video walk-through video will be coming soon.

The application was designed for mobile view, so it will look best with a reduce width to your browser's window.

## Main App Features

Upon the creation of an account, the user chooses a hiking goal (in miles).  There are two main sections to the app: "Your Hiking Log" and "Trails of the Smokies". The Hiking Log shows you any hikes you have logged, including the date of the hike and any comments you've left for the trip.  There is also the option to add a hike in this view.  In the "Trails of the Smokies" view you can browse a variety of hikes in the Great Smoky Mountains with a description of the trail and various stats about the hike including degree of difficulty, length and altitude gained. You will also find a link to Google Maps for directions to the trailhead. You can also add any hike to your hiking log.

Every hike you log will add miles towards your goal. You can change your goal at any point. Once you reach and exceed your goal, you'll receive a congratulations window and the option to create a new goal.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
